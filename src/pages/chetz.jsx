          chetz is a student-led nonprofit organization founded in October 2020
          to connect Japanese students with diverse cultures during the COVID-19
          pandemic. Rooted in the belief that global understanding starts with
          communication, chetz creates online spaces where students can engage,
          grow, and inspire each other. Our core programs include Language
          Exchange, English Learning Support, and Study Abroad Counseling. We
          also host collaborative events and study sessions with fellow student
          organization, building bridges not just across cultures, but across
          communities.

        <p>
          In 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic forced me to return to Japan from
          my high school abroad in Canada, I felt a strong desire to stay
          connected with the world. At the same time, tools like Zoom became
          more accessible, opening up new possibilities for online interaction.
          This inspired me to launch Chetz as a completely online platform,
          enabling global participation regardless of location. At the
          beginning, I managed everything by myself‚Äîpromotion, recruitment,
          website development, and operations. Over time, we grew into a diverse
          team of over 20 members from 6 different countries. Although all of
          our members were high school students, we welcomed anyone regardless
          of age or experience, as long as they shared our passion.
